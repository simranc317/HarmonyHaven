                <p>Sleep hygiene refers to healthy sleep habits that can improve the quality of your sleep. Here are some key practices:</p>
                <p>Keep your bedroom cool, dark, and quiet.</p>
                <p>Avoid napping during the day, especially in the late afternoon or evening.</p>
                <p>Avoid alcohol, nicotine, and heavy meals close to bedtime.</p>
                <p>Exercise regularly, but not too close to bedtime.</p>
                <p>Establish a relaxing bedtime routine, such as reading or taking a warm bath.</p>
                <p>Avoid screens (phones, tablets, computers) at least an hour before bedtime, as the blue light can interfere with your sleep cycle.</p>
                <p>If you can't fall asleep after 20 minutes, get out of bed and do something relaxing until you feel sleepy.</p>
                <p>Limit caffeine intake, especially in the afternoon and evening.</p>
                <p>Manage stress through relaxation techniques like deep breathing or meditation.</p>
